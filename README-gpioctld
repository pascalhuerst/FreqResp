The Analog Discovery device needs to be kept open during flashing
since if it is closed it will eventually reset itself to a default value,
and since the Relais_Power GPIO is attached to this,
it will shut down the SoM.

The FreqResp tool does not have a problem with this since it is interactive,
but for TeamCity builds we need to be able to control the GPIOs
via an easily batch scriptable interface
that can cross multiple shell sessions.

To accomplish this there are systemd units,
which create a UNIX socket in /run/gpioctld.socket
and starts a daemon that opens the Analog Discovery device
and listens for requests to set GPIOs to "on" or "off".

Since clients can't share access to the Analog Discovery device
the FreqResp tool won't work alongside it,
so any Analog Discovery actions that need to be performed during tests
need to either stop the gpioctld service
or extend the gpioctld interface to perform those actions.
